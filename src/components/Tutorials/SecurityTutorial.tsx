        <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold">Why Risk Management Matters</h2>
        <p>
          While crypto revolutionizes finance, it removes traditional safety
          nets. Price volatility, lack of regulation, and self-custody
          challenges mean every user must take responsibility for securing their
          assets.

            <strong>Segment Wallet Usage:</strong> Use hot wallets (e.g.,
            MetaMask, Trust Wallet) for high-risk activity, cold wallets for
            storage, and paper backups for seed phrases.
